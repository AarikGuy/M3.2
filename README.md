# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

We had to replicate a letter completely in html only using the knowledge we already know.
This assignment was a lot of fun. I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I only had to use two of
the links that were provided from Shane. I didn't use google or anything, just those two links.
