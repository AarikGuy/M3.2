  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>
      Dear Eileen,<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for you recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
      of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
    </p>
  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
      could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
          <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
          <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
      <br>
      You can find more information about
      <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/"> important university dates</a> on our website.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
      <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
          <ol>
            <li> H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3) </li>
            <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30C (86F), when the<br>
              audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10^3 increasing to 3 x 10^4.)</li>
            <li><ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores. </li>
          </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
      </p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <I>did</I> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
        <br>
          <dl>
            Polynesian chicken dance<dd>
            A little known but <I>very</I> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".<br>
            </dd>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle<dd>
              Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
              involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>
              tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
              modern styles such as Twerking.
            </dd>
            Arctic robot dance<dd>
              An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
              discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
              of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
              because they were really cold.
